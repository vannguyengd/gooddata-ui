GoodData.UI is a TypeScript framework for building analytical applications on top of the GoodData platform. 

GoodData.UI consists of multiple libraries with clear-cut responsibilities ranging from low-level REST API 
clients up to visualization libraries that deliver React-based components to render different types of charts and tables.

With GoodData.UI, you can:

* Create utility programs that interact directly with the GoodData platform APIs (for example, to automate routine 
  maintenance and management tasks).
   
* Create visualizations of data stored on the GoodData platform using [visual components](10_vis__start_with_visual_components.md).

* Embed insights created in Analytical Designer using [InsightView](10_vis__insight_view.md).

* Create [new visual components](50_custom__create_new_visualization.md) for your data to address your specific analytical needs.

This documentation is intended for front-end software developers and requires JavaScript knowledge.

## Supported technologies - TODO: UPDATE

GoodData.UI is compatible with:

* React 16.5.2, [Angular 1.X](30_tips__use_angular_1.x.md), [Angular 2+](30_tips__use_angular_2.x.md)
* TypeScript 3.3.4000+, ES6, ES5

    **NOTE:** The _latest_ supported version of `@types/react-intl` used within a TypeScript project is 2.3.5. Using a later version may result in errors.
* Node ^8.10.0 or >=9.10.0
* [Officially supported browsers](https://help.gooddata.com/display/doc/System+Requirements+and+Supported+Browsers)

**NOTE:** [Server-side rendering](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.md) is *not* supported.

### Internet Explorer and mandatory polyfill

To run a GoodData.UI application in Internet Explorer 11, you must have the ES6 polyfill. For more information, see the [compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) and the instructions [here](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

If you are using Babel, you can use the [Babel polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) in your index to specifically include only the needed polyfill code.

## GoodData platform account

To use GoodData.UI, you must have an account on the GoodData platform. For basic information about the GoodData platform, see [GoodData Platform Introduction](01_intro__platform_intro.md).

If you want to try out GoodData.UI, we recommend that you sign up for the [live examples](https://gooddata-examples.herokuapp.com) first. You can use the online experience or [run the examples locally on your machine](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-ui-sdk/tree/master/examples/sdk-examples).
